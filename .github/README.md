[AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree][1] program, from Udacity.

## Core Curriculum

### 01. Introduction to Machine Learning

Overview of key background around Machine Learning and preparing you to be
successful in the rest of this course.

- Notebooks:
  - [C1-Introduction.ipynb](../notebooks/C1-Introduction.ipynb)

---

### 02. Exploratory Data Analysis

Use AWS SageMaker Studio to access S3 datasets and perform data analysis,
feature engineering with Data Wrangler and Pandas. And finally, label new data
using SageMaker Ground Truth.

- Notebooks:
  - [C2-EDA.ipynb](../notebooks/C2-EDA.ipynb)
  - [B1-AWS.ipynb](../notebooks/B1-AWS.ipynb)

### 03. Machine Learning Concepts

In this lesson you'll learn about ML Lifecycles, how to differentiate between
Supervised vs. Unsupervised ML, regression methods, and classification methods.

### 04. Model Deployment Workflow

In this lesson, you'll load a dataset, clean/create features, train a
regression/classification model with Scikit Learn, evaluate a model and tune a
model's hyperparameter.
